## My opinion about this course

Not that hard, not that easy. A convenient all-encompassing course for entry-level data analysts.

Much of the parts in this courses are non-programming-related knowledge, so if you like me are a computer science based person, you may feel confused and boring.

But it did cover knowledge points what I need but didn't recognize before.
